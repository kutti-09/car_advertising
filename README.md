# Car Advertising-Determining Futuristic Sales


## Aim:

The ultimate goal of the project is to build a **machine learning model** that could predict the futuristic sales of a car given its current sales current advertising medium spends.

## Hardware/Software Preference:
A windows PC with windows 10 or higher software/ Macbook updated to the latest version is Preferrable.

## Suggested Tools/Tech Stacks:
Python 3 latest version, Jupyter Notebook, any similar IDE with its most recent version,with necessary libraries/dependencies/packages could be used for working in this project.


## Suggested Approach: 

Step 1:  Download the advertising dataset.

Step 2:  Import it into the environment(say Jupyter Notebook) and store it as a dataframe.

Step 3:  Check data for its values,measures of central tendency and dispersion.

Step 4: Perform data preprocessing such as Null value treatment/missing value treatment and outlier treatment.

Step 5: Perform Visualisations, Univariate and Bi-Variate Analysis and find correlations,trends and patterns among the variable.

Step 6: You can now split the data into X and Y to make it ready for training purposes.

Step 7: You can now train the data with a Regression Model(say Linear Regression Model) with appropriate train test split. 

Step 8: Test the data by giving X-test as a parameter. Now you can get the value for Y-predicted, which is your futuristic value.

Step 9: Compare it against the original Y-Test value and calculate the MSE,MAE etc. The model with least error is the best model.

## Expected Output:

A regresssion model is built to predict the futuristic sales with present data and the accuracy of the model is measured.
